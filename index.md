### Hi, I'm Windsey ðŸ‘‹
My name is Wenjie Ma. I am a visiting scholar at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, working with Prof. [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io). I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Nanjing University (China) in June, 2023. I am broadly interested in the theories and applications of Computer Systems and Programming Languages.

I am applying for PhD programs in this application season. Feel free to email me to talk about research, application or anything on how to have fun in this world.

You can always contact me if you think I can do something to help you/make you happy.
