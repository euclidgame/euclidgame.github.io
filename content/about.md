I am a visiting scholar at UIUC, working with Prof. [Tianyin Xu](https://euclidgame.github.io). I have recently got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (top 0.5\%) from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/About/Message_from_the_Leadership.htm).

Rather than confining myself to a specific area, I have this research vision[^1]: I enjoy creating *general*
and *rigorous* abstractions for programs--they are beautiful, and exploring their applications in *complex* modern software systems. I believe that
leveraging these abstractions holds great potential to develop principled methods for building secure and reliable software systems. 
That said, I am simple and complicated, imaginative and practical at the same time.

Over the past two years, I have done some work at the intersection of **programming languages** (PL) and **software systems**,
especially formal verification of distributed systems and static analysis of large-scale programs. 

<!-- I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (top 0.5\%) from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/About/Message_from_the_Leadership.htm) in June 2023. As an undergraduate, I conducted research with Prof. 
[Yue Li](https://yuelee.bitbucket.io) and Prof. [Tian Tan](https://silverbullettt.bitbucket.io) on improving the precision and
efficiency of traditional pointer analysis. -->

### Talks
1. "Context Sensitivity without Contexts: A Cut-Shortcut Approach to Fast and Precise Pointer Analysis'', *PLDI 2023*

### Teaching
1. [*Static Program Analysis*](https://tai-e.pascal-lab.net/en/intro/overview.html), *2022 Fall*, Nanjing University  
    - A course of static analysis for both graduates and undergraduates (180 students enrolled in).
    - The [programming assignments](https://oj.pascal-lab.net/problem) have been registered by students from 140+ universities all over the world.

### Personal
I like bakery, reading, pilates[^2] and flower arrangement if I want to stay calm. Otherwise, I would like to go boxing, singing
and dancing.

My friends call me a "*food researcher*".
